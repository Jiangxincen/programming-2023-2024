Headings
To create headings we use hash symbols(#)
We can also create different "level"headings
To create subheadings, we use multiple hashes

This is a subheading level2

This is a level 3 subheading

Level 6 is the smallest

modifying text style
we can use asterisks (*)to modify text style, specifically
bold and italics
I want this **word** to be bold
I want this word to be italicized
I want this word to be both bold and italicized
this whole sentence is emphasized


aside:escape characters
If we want to place a character that is ALREADY
a keyword or reserved character we use the back 
slash(\)


strikethrough
We can strike through characters or words using the 
tilde
_e.g_


## links
links allow us to reference information externally
[A tool YOU might use](https://chat.openai.com)



if you don't 
create two more links to some other 
website you think is useful

[Google] from chatgpt
[Reddit] 
[YOUTUBE]

images



# Blockquotes
Block quotes allow us to emphasize a bigger chunk of text.
We use carets (>) to create blockquotes.

e.g.

> This is an example of a *blockquote*
> This is line two of a blockquote
> 
> This is line four of the blockquote; the third is blank
## list
we can create both unordered and ordered lists 

# unordered lists

to create each point, we use asterisks(**)with a space behind


## ordered lists
if there is a specific order to the elements in our list,
we can create an order list
we use numbers, followed


## table
we can organize information in tables using markdown
we use dashes(-)and pipes(|)

tables in markdown require headings
